# SofÃ­a Gracia - Task List

Hi everyone! Welcome to my cute task list, you can use it! but with local storage, hope you like it. Please feel free to give me any feedback

> **First things first:** You need to have [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/) installed to run this project

### Steps to enjoy this lovely code I made:

1. Better **download** it than using git clone.
2. **Install dependencies** by typing the following in a terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the project! with:

```bash
npm start
```

## About the project

I made it during a bootcamp to practice React and the local storage feature. There are some by default task but the users can erase and create whatever they need. They can also check when some task is finished.

### thank you and have fun!
